typeScript
mikro-orm
postgreSQL
graphql with ts types
appolo-server-express
express(ofc) 
Argon2(can use bcrypt)
express-session (to maintain sessions)
redis(to maintain session faster. Can you postgreSQL too)
connect-redis (for above too) with ts types


/* How redis works roughly */

req.session.userId = user.userId

{userId: 1} -> send to redis

sess: trtwerwe -> {userId:1} + secret

express-session will set cookie on browser as data+secret(trtwerwe) maybe as 343243242gfdgfd

when user makes a request:
343243242gfdgfd -> sent to server 

decrypt cookie
343243242gfdgfd -> Sess: trtwerwe

make request to redis with key
Sess: trtwerwe -> {userId : 1}

req.session = {userId : 1}
